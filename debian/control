Description: gtk-based recipe organizer and shopping list generator
 Gourmet Recipe Manager is a gtk-based recipe organizer and shopping list
 generator intended for the GNOME desktop environment (though it does not
 need all the GNOME libraries). Gourmet can import Mealmaster(tm) files and
 can export recipes in a number of formats, including text, RTF and web
 pages. Gourmet also can calculate nutritional information for recipes.
