	* data/recipe.dtd Add link
	* glade/recCard.glade Move title and shopping-list button above
	other stuff to un-clutter ingredient text and keep title in view
	at all times.
	* src/lib/reccard.py Default to highlighting calories, and save
	last-highlighted nutritional item as a preference. Update flowing
	to take into account different default widths (so that our title,
	which is not the width of the whole card, can be wrapped
	appropriately). Highlight ingredients with boldness as well as
	color. Also, change color highlighting so that all items with some
	of the content will have a visible amount of yellow behind them.
	* src/lib/nutrition/nutritionLabel.py Hide MINOR items for which
	there is no nutritional content. Also, track toggles in a
	dictionary so that callers can programatically toggle highlighting
	(i.e. so that we can store preferences for which nutritional info
	to highlight)
