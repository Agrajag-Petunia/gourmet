Getting Started:

Before you start coding, you should first build localized *.mo and
*.gourmet-plugin files within a build/ subdirectory of the source tree by
running

    python setup.py build_i18n -m

Afterwards, you can just launch bin/gourmet from the source directory to test
the program and see how changes to the source code affect it.

Style:

The style used in Gourmet can be rather varied. However, new code
should adhere to style guidelines old code should be updated to meet
them. Generally, we try to follow the python style guidelines set out
by Mr. Guido Van Russom.

The following conventions are not strictly followed in Gourmet, but
I'd like to follow them from here on out for greater consistency.

* Class names are capitalized, using CamelCase.
* method names begin with verbs and use underscores for multiple words
* attributes should be lower cased and use camel caps for multiple words.
