TODO
* Python 2.6 Compatability
   - interactive importer & Threads module (Threads now complained if
   not initialized and we set name).

* Change from servings to yield
   Allow different kinds of yields, not just servings. This will let a
   recipe specify its yield in any logical way (loaves, cups,
   servings, etc)
   - Recipe card [X]
   - Recipe index [X]
   - importer base classes [X]
     - Changes: convert_servings -> convert_str_to_num
   - exporter base classes [X]
   - printing
   - Plugins
     - Importer plugins
     - Exporter plugins [X]

* Add support for importing/exporting nutritional information
   Add support for importing/exporting nutritional information into
   the gourmet XML fileformat import and export

* Import GNOME Cookbook recipes 
   
* Fix export when including a linked recipe. [X]
   Multiple export now automatically includes any linked
   recipes. Individual export does not, because we can't expect
   individual exporters to be able to handle multiple recipes by
   default (for example, the single-web-page exporter doesn't handle
   multiple recipes by default).

* Fail elegantly when missing required modules for a plugin[X]
* Make shopping list pluggable [X]
* Implement a "browsing" interface [X]
   Implement a browsing interface to browse through recipes by
   category/cuisine/etc.

   Add nutritional info to exports optional support for writing
   nutritional information into export formats for display (PDF,
   print, html, etc)
